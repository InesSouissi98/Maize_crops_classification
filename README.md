# Maize crops classification

Fall Armyworm is a serious pest that affects several economically important crops, including maize, rice, and sorghum. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of the pest can help farmers take appropriate measures to manage its spread and minimize crop losses. In this project, we will develop a deep learning model to classify plant images as either infected or uninfected by fall armyworm.

The dataset can be obtained from various sources, including publicly available databases or by collecting images from the field. The dataset should include a variety of images taken from different angles and under different lighting conditions, with a csv file that represents the class of each image.

Deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19 and CNN model will be tested and evaluated for their performance in classifying the plant images. The best-performing model will be selected. They will be evaluated using accuracy as a performance metric.
